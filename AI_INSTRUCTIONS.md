waw-sem is the server engine module of the waw framework. It provides the runtime pieces that turn a set of waw modules into a running backend: an Express HTTP server, optional MongoDB connection and session storage, Socket.IO real-time transport, and a declarative CRUD engine. When loaded, sem exposes `waw.app`, `waw.server`, and `waw.express`, provides `waw.router(basePath)` for mounting module routers, and sets common helpers such as `waw.ensure(req,res,next)` and `waw.role(roles, middleware)` for authorization. Sem also provides `waw.socket` with `io`, `emit(to, message, room?)`, and `add(fn)` to extend connection behavior, and it provides `waw.crud` to register CRUD behavior from module configuration and finalize route generation. At startup, sem loads every `*.collection.js` file from all modules (to register Mongoose models / schemas), then loads every `*.api.js` file (to register routes/endpoints), then calls `waw.crud.finalize()` to generate CRUD endpoints, and finally starts listening on `waw.config.port` (default `8080`).
